B- in all 20 frames, there were two failers. frame 13 and frame 20 (note that the algorithm found the most corr with the same object in both frames)

frame 13 was caused because the bird was hidden behind something and so there wasent any correlection between it and a "noraml" bird as it just didnt look like one
frame 20 was caused because the bird was tilted a bit too much, we had the bird being horisontal as the template so when it was tilted it didnt look like the same bird.

i attached frames 1,3,10,18 just for examples for when the alogrithm was right- it was right on all of the frames bar the two that was noted above.
