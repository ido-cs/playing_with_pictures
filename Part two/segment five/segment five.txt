C- looking at the keys we can see that using the vertical kernel we keep and enhance the vertical lines in the image and by
using the horizontal one we keep and enhance the horisontal parts of the image.

E- we used median filter and not avg one because the image is binnary and we would wish to keep it that way. using avg one would turn the
image into grayscale.
