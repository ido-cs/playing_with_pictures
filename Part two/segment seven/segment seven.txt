B- the only "flaws" in the picture is the horse. the car was not affected due to it having set height while every part of the horse has
different height. the algorithm "moved" upward and so it got the horse feet before it got its head so it looks a little messed.

C- this time we moved with the movment of the horse, each line we collected had the horse in it and therefore it seems as if there is one
big horse in the picture.

D- this time we moved oposite to the movment of the horse and therefore had fewer frames with the horse inside of them, so it looks squished.
