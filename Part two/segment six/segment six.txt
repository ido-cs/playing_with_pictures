A- the better operator is based on what do we look for. if we want to keep evry edge (for example the edge of the table in the picture)
we would better use sobel as it clearly outline all edges, and if we're only interested in the main edges we would rather use canny 
as its much clearer. it looks as if roberts has some "noise" to it.

B- looking at the noised picture its obvious that roberts is the best edge detection operator. sobel is unusable and canny cant detect all of the edges.
C- a=0.5 yeald the best image. the operator seems to be kind of "sharpening" by subtracting the scaled laplacian from the image.
using higher scale sharp the image too much while lower scale makes it somewhat blurry.

D- we can see the noise amplifier most notably in the 0.75 scale. the operator use the laplacian, a second derivitive, so as most
discrete derivitives it would emplify discontinuities such as s&p noise. we can think about it like the "slope" of the intensity
is very large in place of discontinuity.

E- to combat discontinuity we need to use an integral based filter and not derivitive based one. such filter that use the neighbourhood
of the point to determine its value. i used median filter to filter out the s&p noise and only then used the operator in question.
