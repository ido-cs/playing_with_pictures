B- obviously anna's angle resemble anna much more then anna's amplitude.
C- we can see that the random amplitude looks like anna but without the "light" while the random angle looks like a random mush of white and black.
D- based on previous parts we can conclude that angle is much more important to the understanding of the picture.
